Custom True Dual-Port BRAM

Based off and modified from "Design and Implementation of Synchronous Dual-Port Memory" by Aayush Pandey et al., ICDCECE 2024

Project implements a TDP BRAM  design in Verilog, capable of simultaneous read and write operations on two independent ports.
It also includes a testbench to compare asynchronous and synchronous read behaviors while detecting collisions between ports.

Features-

2 independent ports- both async and sync

configurable Read Modes

fully parameterized Design

dual clk enable

single port Mode

collision detection and prevention system
